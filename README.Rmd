# Compile

The following instructions describe how to reproduce a copy of the source files for most of our  analysis of Ca^2+ waves in our manuscript. describing reproducible workflows, and create the PDF. Either, you can go the 'standard' way of downloading a local copy of the repository and knit the "full_analysis.Rmd" file in R, or you can use the reproducible workflow as suggested and use Make to create a container and build the final PDF file in exactly the same virtual computational environment that we used to render the PDF.

>NOTE: No sure if I will use the standard way or just the docker option... got a check later

## Standard Way

Requires: `Git`, `RStudio`, `pandoc`, `pandoc-citeproc` & `rmarkdown`.

Open RStudio -> File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git

Insert:

```
https://github.com/rjlopez2/CPVT-SERCA_paper
```

Open `full_analysis.Rmd` click on `Knit`.

## Using a Reproducible Workflow

Does not require R or RStudio, but `make` & `docker`.

Execute in Terminal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/rjlopez2/cpvt-serca_paper.git
cd cpvt-serca_paper
make build
make all DOCKER=TRUE
```

**Note: Windows user need to manually edit the `Makefile` and set current_path to the current directory and use `make all DOCKER=TRUE WINDOWS=TRUE`. We hope that future releases of Docker for Windows will not require that workaround.**

## Rebuild Everything

In case you experience some unexpected behavior with this workflow, you should check that you have the most recent version (`git pull`), rebuild the docker image (`make build`) and force the rebuild of all targets (`make -B DOCKER`).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git pull && make rebuild && make -B DOCKER=TRUE
```

# Session Info
