# Compile

The following instructions describe how to reproduce a copy of the source files for most of our  analysis of Ca^2+^ waves in our manuscript. this isntructions are heavily inspired by Aaron Peikert and you can read more [here](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8xzqy). We describe reproducible workflows, and create .html documents as well as individual figures, summary statistics and test performed in our data. Either, you can go the 'standard' way of downloading a local copy of the repository and knit each markdown file(s) located under the folder `code` using RStudio, or you can use the reproducible workflow as suggested and use Make to create a container and build the final results in exactly the same virtual computational environment that we used to render the .html


## Standard Way

Requires: `Git`, `RStudio`, `pandoc`, `pandoc-citeproc`, `rmarkdown` & `renv`.

Open RStudio -> File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git

Insert:

```
https://github.com/rjlopez2/CPVT-SERCA_paper
```
>you have to check if this actually work with the {renv} package

to restore all the dependencies, run from within the RStudio's console this command and follow the instructions:

```
renv::restore()
```

Go to the folder `code` and open `full_analysis.Rmd` click on `Knit`.

Do the same for the additional markdown files.


## Using a Reproducible Workflow

Does not require R or RStudio, but `make` & `docker`.

Before you start, make sure that you have installed in your machine make and docker. In this [tutorial](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/reproducible-research#resources) is fairly well explained how to install it depending on your system.

Execute in Terminal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/rjlopez2/cpvt-serca_paper.git
cd cpvt-serca_paper
make build
make all DOCKER=TRUE OUTPUT=TRUE
```

if you wish not to have the output (summary tables and figures), but just the html files, run the last line with `OUTPUT=FALSE`


**Note: Windows user need to manually edit the `Makefile` and set current_path to the current directory and use `make all DOCKER=TRUE WINDOWS=TRUE`. We hope that future releases of Docker for Windows will not require that workaround.**

## Rebuild Everything

In case you experience some unexpected behavior with this workflow, you should check that you have the most recent version (`git pull`), rebuild the docker image (`make build`) and force the rebuild of all targets (`make -B DOCKER`).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git pull && make rebuild && make -B DOCKER=TRUE
```
